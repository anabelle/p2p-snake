# Code Quality Mandatory Rules

## 1. Gather Context (MANDATORY)

*   **Baseline Check:** Before starting any work or addressing an issue, ensure a clean slate by running a mandatory `npm run verify`.
*   **Understand the Scope:** Always review relevant sections of `package.json` (scripts, dependencies) and understand the local file/directory structure before doing anything.

## 2. Development Cycle (TDD Always)

*   **Test First:** Aim for a Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach.
*   **Write a Failing Test:** Before implementing a feature or fixing a bug, write a specific test (unit or Cypress E2E) that clearly defines the desired outcome or reproduces the problem. Ensure this test fails as expected.
*   **Implement/Fix:** Write the minimal code required to make the failing test pass.
*   **Refactor:** Improve the code structure and clarity while ensuring all tests still pass.
*   **Iterative Testing:** During development, run relevant tests frequently to get fast feedback. Use targeted commands like `npm test -- --testPathPattern=yourFile.test.ts --watchAll=false` or specific Cypress commands, ensure to disable watch mode so you dont get stuck.
*   **Troubleshooting Webpack Overlays:** If a `webpack-dev-server-client-overlay` appears during Cypress tests, run `npm run build` to get clearer error messages from the build process.

## 3. Final Checks & Cleanup

*   **Comprehensive Verification:** Before considering work complete or committing changes, run the full `npm run verify` suite to catch any regressions.
*   **Linting & Formatting:** Run `npm run lint` and `npm run format`. Fix any errors or warnings reported.
*   **Final Verification:** After *all* code changes, including lint/format fixes, run `npm run verify` one last time to guarantee everything is still working correctly.

Additional notes:

* If a test fails repeatedly due to Jest.Mock vs jest.mock type just use any.

Tools:

* You have access to the terminal use git to revert files when trying different things if its useful
