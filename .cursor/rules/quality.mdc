# Code Qualiy

- Use TDD always
- If you see overlay of webpack-dev-server-client-overlay in cypress, run npm run build to see the error instead of forcing anything.
- Before making any edits run the following command to get context: "npm run verify"
- After making any edits run the following commands to verify you didnt break anything: "npm run verify"
- when everything is ok run: npm run lint and npm run format and fix any warnings or errors in the process
- then run "npm run verify" after the last modification before saying success.
